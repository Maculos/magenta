First of all, why are you looking this deep into my github?
Second this is mostly for me so ignore it
Anyway here's how I determine my license of each project:
My average projects, the useless ones go under CC0
The kinda-useful but unlikely to be of much use are under MIT
And on the delusional future that I make something actually useful it'll go under LGPL3
